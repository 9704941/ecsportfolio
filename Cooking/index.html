	  <h3>Cooking is one of my favorite things to do and I love to cook for the people I love. Cooking takes time is a proccess that needs patience and it has taught me that. I really grew my love of cooking from my sister who also had a passion
for baking and cooking. She taught me how to cook some of the first dishes of made which grew my love for cooking. To me cooking is not only about eating the food but it is almost like an art that needs a mix of food to make a new flavor or taste .</h3>
